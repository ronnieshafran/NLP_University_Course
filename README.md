# Exercises from the University Of Haifa's NLP Course (Spring 2022).

Run the scripts as you would any Python script. Make sure to add paths to files as command-line arguments. 

Exercise 1: 
        The script loads various corpus files and free-text files (not included in git - use any file) to create a combined corpus, which is then printed out, sentence by sentence.
        
-- Arguments: Path-To-XML-Files-Directory, Path-To-Text-Files-Directory, Path-to-output-file

Exercise 2: 
  1) The script calculates the probability of given sentences (hard coded, found in main function) based on given corpuses.
  2) The script generates random sentences using the Unigram, Bigram and Trigram models based on given corpuses.
  
  -- Arguments: Path-To-XML-Files-Directory, Path-to-output-file
