# Exercises from the University Of Haifa's NLP Course (Spring 2022).


Exercise 1: 
        
        The script loads various corpus files and free-text files (not included in git - use any file)
        to create a combined corpus, which is then printed out, sentence by sentence.
        


Exercise 2: 

          1) The script calculates the probability of given sentences (hard coded, found in main function) based on given corpuses.
          2) The script generates random sentences using the Unigram, Bigram and Trigram models based on given corpuses.
  
  
  
  
Exercise 3:
     
     The script divides given Corpus XMLs to chunk of 10 sentences,
     who are then used to train a KNN model to predict the gender of the author.
     
Exercise 4:
       
       The script uses word embedding models for various tasks: predict words in analogy pairs,
       change lyrics in a given song and classify tweets according to categories.

Exercise 5:
        
        The script is an implementation of the probablistic version of the CKY algorithm.
        Given grammar rules and sentences, it constructs the parsing trees and outputs probability.
